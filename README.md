# Learning software development

## Purpose
The idea behind this git repository is to centralize and illustrate my learning of software development and languages (such as C, C++, Rust, Go)
Each tag is a demo of a prototype about one knowledge.
Find a "red thread project" who illustrate all things I will learn.
Add GitHub Actions for continous integration and code quality coverage.
Find and learn things in right way, modern C/C++ development and good practices.
